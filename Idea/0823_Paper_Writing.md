# 0823: Paper Writing

### 10 minutes random idea

Academic writing is also one essential part of the research. To enhance my ability, I must place 120% percent effort on it. Otherwise, I worry I will feel shame and upset about it. As proven by so many well-known writers, the key to good paper is to spend regular time on it, thinking it and improving it day by day.



Travelling is a good approach to relax my mind, but sometimes it goes too far away from the practical path. For example, I become unfamiliar with the code and work again. Meanwhile, I, again, start to get reluctant to make progress, which is very harmful to teamwork 

<!-- Oh shit there is a man smoking here, very smelly....  I changed my seat -->

Okey, let us come back to the right path
