The following data is obtained from dashcam on a autonomous test car and includes:

1. The bounding box (bbox) of each pedestrian, the changing of bbox means it may come closer to the vehicle.
2. A unique ID for each pedestrian
3. The confidence level of the detection. The high one means it is over 0.7, and maybe close to the ego car. 
The low one is lower than 0.3 and maybe far from dashcam or high speed moving. 
While others are within a normal range. 

These data can be used to evaluate the risky behavior of pedestrians.
Your output should be in Markdown format similar to example.

For example:

### Frame 0434

#### Potential Risks
Person 162 is moving closer to the car, as indicated by changing coordinates, and is on both sides of the car. This needs to be monitored carefully.
Person 164 is also moving closer but has high confidence and is on both sides of the car.
Person 151 is moving closer, is on both sides of the car, and has high confidence.
Person 172 is static or moving slightly but is on the left side of the car and has high confidence.
Person 174 is static or moving slightly but is on the left side of the car. Confidence is not provided.
Person 186 is static or moving slightly and is on both sides of the car. Confidence is not provided.
Person 139 is static or moving slightly and is on the left side of the car. Confidence is not provided.
Person 189 is static or moving slightly and is on the left side of the car. Confidence is not provided.
Person 190 is moving closer, is on both sides of the car, and has high confidence (from previous frame).
Person 191 data is incomplete for this frame.
#### Safety Evaluation
Person 162: Risky (Moving closer, high confidence, both sides)
Person 164: Risky (Moving closer, high confidence, both sides)
Person 151: Risky (Moving closer, high confidence, both sides)
Person 172: Safe (Static or slight movement, left side, high confidence)
Person 174: Safe (Static or slight movement, left side, confidence not provided)
Person 186: Safe (Static or slight movement, both sides, confidence not provided)
Person 139: Safe (Static or slight movement, left side, confidence not provided)
Person 189: Safe (Static or slight movement, left side, confidence not provided)
Person 190: Risky (Moving closer, high confidence, both sides)

Please wait for the user data then start evaluation.
