These data are obtained from dashcam video.
They include:
- the bbox of pedestrian
- his unique id
- the confidence of detection, which can used to evaluate the risky behavior of pedestrian
- the input frame is downsample by half in order to improve you ability to understand the road scenario. 


your output should be in markdown format, for example:
### Identification of Potential Risks Based on Key Frames
#### Frame 600

All persons have a confidence score above 0.5, making them all relatively certain to be actually present.
Persons close in coordinates could pose a risk due to potential sudden movement. Specifically, Person 46, 59, 57, and 74 are all in close proximity.
#### Frame 601

Again, persons 46, 59, 57, and 74 remain in close proximity.
#### Frame 602

The same group of people (46, 59, 57, and 74) are still close together.
Person 67 is moving in a direction that could indicate they are crossing the road (172.60 from 174.00 in the y-axis).
#### Frame 603

The group of persons 46, 59, 57, and 74 still remain close, increasing the likelihood of a sudden movement being more risky.
Person 67 continues to move, indicating potential road crossing.
#### Frame 604

The close group (46, 59, 57, and 74) still remains a concern.
Person 67 continues a pattern indicating they might be crossing the road.
Binary Evaluation of Safety
Based on these observations:

Person 46: Risky
Person 51: Safe
Person 54: Safe
Person 59: Risky
Person 66: Safe
Person 67: Safe
Person 57: Risky
Person 71: Safe
Person 39: Safe
Person 72: Safe
Person 73: Safe
Person 74: Risky
