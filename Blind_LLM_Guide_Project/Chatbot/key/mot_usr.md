These data are obtained from dashcam video.
They include:
- the bbox of pedestrian
- his unique id
- the input frame is downsample by half in order to improve you ability to understand the road scenario. 


your output should be in markdown format, for example:
### Frame 0 Analysis
Person 1: Coordinates are [-21.95, 662.12] which implies the person is quite close to the vehicle. The bounding box dimensions, although negative which doesn't make much logical sense, suggest a human-sized object.
Evaluation: Dangerous
Person 2: Located far away at coordinates [1098.65, 677.22], suggesting they are not an immediate risk.
Evaluation: Safe
Person 3: Similar to Person 2, located at a distance at coordinates [848.19, 709.19].
Evaluation: Safe
### Frame 5 Analysis
Person 2: Continues to be at a distance [1118.80, 640.42], no immediate threat.
Evaluation: Safe
Person 3: Still far from the vehicle at [854.42, 679.27].
Evaluation: Safe
Person 4: Located at [135.89, 649.94], relatively closer compared to Persons 2 and 3, but still not an immediate risk.
Evaluation: Safe
### Frame 10 Analysis
Person 2: Still far away at [1149.64, 623.07].
Evaluation: Safe
Person 3: No change in distance, still far at [866.94, 662.15].
Evaluation: Safe
Person 4: Has moved slightly closer to the vehicle at [91.76, 635.99] but not dangerously close.
