I now have the following data obtained from dashcam video. 

- the geometric central positions of people and roads are divided into six parts on average:
  Upper left, upper middle, upper right, lower left, lower middle, lower right
- the angles are measured with respect to the image plane, which serves as a parallel plane to the dashcam lens. Analyzing these angles provides insights into the spatial relationships between the vehicle and pedestrians.  

your output should be in markdown format, for example:
### Frame 0002 Analysis

**Summary of Key Frame Information:**
- **Road Position:** The road (road 0) is located in the middle-down region of the frame.
- **Sidewalk Position:** The sidewalk (sidewalk 1) is located in the right-down region of the frame.
- **People Positions and Distances:**
  - **Person 0:** Located at middle-down, very close to the dashcam, with an angle of 89.98 degrees. On road 0, sidewalk 1.
  - **Person 1:** Located at left-down, very close to the dashcam, with an angle of -89.98 degrees. On road 0, sidewalk 1.
  - **Person 2:** Located at middle-down, very close to the dashcam, with an angle of 89.98 degrees. On road 0, sidewalk 1.
  - **Person 3:** Located at left-down, very close to the dashcam, with an angle of -89.99 degrees. On road 0.
  - **Person 4:** Located at middle-down, very close to the dashcam, with an angle of -89.98 degrees. On road 0.
  - **Person 5:** Located at middle-down, very close to the dashcam, with an angle of -89.92 degrees. Not on any detected surface.

**Potential Risks:**
- **Persons on Road and Sidewalk:** Persons 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are on the road or sidewalk, posing a potential risk of collision.
- **Close Proximity to Dashcam:** All detected persons are very close to the dashcam, indicating a crowded and potentially dangerous situation.
- **Non-Detected Surfaces:** Person 5 is not on any detected surface, which could indicate an unexpected position or movement pattern.

**Risk Evaluation:**
- **Person 0:** High (on road and sidewalk, very close to the dashcam, near 90-degree angle)
- **Person 1:** High (on road and sidewalk, very close to the dashcam, near -90-degree angle)
- **Person 2:** High (on road and sidewalk, very close to the dashcam, near 90-degree angle)
- **Person 3:** High (on road, very close to the dashcam, negative angle)
- **Person 4:** High (on road, very close to the dashcam, negative angle)
- **Person 5:** Medium (not on any detected surface, very close to the dashcam, negative angle)

The situation in Frame 0002 is more critical compared to the previous frame, as more persons are now detected on the road. The high-risk evaluation for Persons 0 through 4 is due to their positions on the road or sidewalk, very close proximity to the dashcam, and angles near the extremes of the field of view. Person 5, who is not on any detected surface, is considered a medium risk. Immediate and cautious action may be required to avoid a potential collision.
