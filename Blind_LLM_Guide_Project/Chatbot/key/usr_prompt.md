I now have the following data obtained from video_0194 shot by dashcam. 

- the geometric central positions of people and roads are divided into six parts on average:
  Upper left, upper middle, upper right, lower left, lower middle, lower right
- the angles are measured with respect to the image plane, which serves as a parallel plane to the dashcam lens. Analyzing these angles provides insights into the spatial relationships between the vehicle and pedestrians.  
  - The left most pedestrian is -90 degree, while the right most to be 90, the man in front of the camera is 0 degree

I will upload the key frame file for your analysis
