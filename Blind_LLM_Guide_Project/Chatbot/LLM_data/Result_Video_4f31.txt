  - **Person 3:** Located at middle-up, close to the dashcam, with an angle slightly to the right. Not on any detected surface. Bounding box coordinates: [709.55237, 265.0207, 740.0532, 353.62012].

**Potential Risks:**
- **Persons on Road and Sidewalk:** Persons 0, 1, and 2 are on the road or sidewalk, posing a potential risk of collision.
- **Close Proximity to Dashcam:** Persons 2 and 3 are close to the dashcam, indicating a potentially crowded and dangerous situation.
- **Non-Detected Surface:** Person 3 is not on any detected surface, which could indicate an unexpected position or movement pattern.

**Risk Evaluation:**
- **Person 0:** Medium (on road and sidewalk, very far from the dashcam, angle far to the right)
- **Person 1:** Medium (on road and sidewalk, very far from the dashcam, angle to the right)
- **Person 2:** Low (on road and sidewalk, close to the dashcam, angle slightly to the right)
- **Person 3:** Medium (not on any detected surface, close to the dashcam, angle slightly to the right)

The situation in Frame 0077 indicates a relatively lower risk compared to previous frames. Persons 0 and 1, although on the road and sidewalk, are very far from the dashcam and have angles indicating they are more to the right. Person 2, who is close to the dashcam, poses a low risk due to their position and angle. Person 3, who is not on any detected surface, is considered a medium risk due to their close proximity to the dashcam. Caution should still be exercised to ensure the safety of all individuals involved.
### Frame 0078 Analysis

**Summary of Key Frame Information:**
- **Road Position:** The road (road 0) is located in the middle-down region of the frame.
- **Sidewalk Positions:** 
  - Sidewalk 1 is located in the right-down region of the frame.
  - Sidewalk 2 is located in the left-up region of the frame.
- **People Positions and Distances:**
  - **Person 0:** Located at right-up, very far from the dashcam, with an angle far to the right. On road 0, sidewalk 1, sidewalk 2. Bounding box coordinates: [1225.8022, 253.15887, 1262.0693, 417.74976].
  - **Person 1:** Located at right-up, very far from the dashcam, with an angle to the right. On road 0, sidewalk 1, sidewalk 2. Bounding box coordinates: [969.3595, 259.67365, 1013.5775, 350.8247].

**Potential Risks:**
- **Persons on Road and Sidewalk:** Persons 0 and 1 are on the road and sidewalks, posing a potential risk of collision.
- **Distance and Angle:** Both persons are very far from the dashcam, indicating a lower immediate risk of collision.

**Risk Evaluation:**
- **Person 0:** Low (on road and sidewalks, very far from the dashcam, angle far to the right)
- **Person 1:** Low (on road and sidewalks, very far from the dashcam, angle to the right)

The situation in Frame 0078 is relatively safer compared to previous frames, as both persons are far from the dashcam and not in immediate proximity to the road. The low-risk evaluation for Persons 0 and 1 is due to their positions on the road and sidewalks, far distance from the dashcam, and angles indicating a rightward direction. However, caution should still be exercised to ensure their movements do not pose any future risks.
### Frame 0079 Analysis

**Summary of Key Frame Information:**
- **Road Position:** The road (road 0) is located in the middle-down region of the frame.
- **Sidewalk Position:** The sidewalk (sidewalk 1) is located in the right-down region of the frame.
- **People Positions and Distances:**
  - **Person 0:** Located at right-up, very far to the right, with a bounding box of [1042.9897, 256.98895, 1088.9773, 356.93317]. On road 0, sidewalk 1.

**Potential Risks:**
- **Person on Road:** Person 0 is on the road, posing a potential risk of collision.
- **Far Distance:** Person 0 is very far from the dashcam, indicating a lower immediate risk.

**Risk Evaluation:**
- **Person 0:** Low (on road, far distance, to the right)

The situation in Frame 0079 shows a person (Person 0) on the road, but the person is located far to the right and at a considerable distance from the dashcam. Therefore, the risk evaluation for Person 0 is low. However, it is still important to monitor the person's movement and take necessary precautions to ensure safety.
### Frame 0080 Analysis

**Summary of Key Frame Information:**
- **Road Position:** The road (road 0) is located in the middle-down region of the frame.
- **Sidewalk Positions:** 
  - Sidewalk 1 is located in the right-down region of the frame.
  - Sidewalk 2 is located in the left-down region of the frame.
- **Person 0 Position and Distance:**
  - Person 0 is located at the right-up region of the frame.
  - The distance of Person 0 is very far.
  - The angle of Person 0 is far to the right.
  - Person 0 is on road 0 and also on sidewalk 1 and sidewalk 2.
  - The bounding box coordinates of Person 0 are [1154.5336, 261.1563, 1215.4808, 372.72986].

**Potential Risks:**
- **Person 0:** Person 0 is on the road and also on both sidewalks (sidewalk 1 and sidewalk 2). Although Person 0 is far away from the vehicle, their position on the road and sidewalks indicates a potential risk of unexpected movement or crossing.

**Risk Evaluation:**
- **Person 0:** Medium (on road and sidewalks, far distance, far to the right angle)

In Frame 0080, the key focus is on Person 0, who is located at the right-up region of the frame. Although Person 0 is far away from the vehicle, their presence on the road and sidewalks suggests a potential risk. The medium-risk evaluation is based on their position on the road and sidewalks, as well as the far distance and far to the right angle. Caution should be exercised to monitor Person 0's movements and ensure their safety.
