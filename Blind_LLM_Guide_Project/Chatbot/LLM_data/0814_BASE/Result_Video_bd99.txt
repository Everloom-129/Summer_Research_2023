**Risk Evaluation:**
- **Person 0:** Medium (on road and sidewalk, very far from the dashcam, angle far to the left)
- **Person 1:** Medium (on road and sidewalk, very far from the dashcam, angle far to the left)
- **Person 3:** High (on road and sidewalk, very close to the dashcam, undefined angle)
- **Person 4:** High (on road and sidewalk, very close to the dashcam, angle to the right)

In Frame 0080, there are four persons detected on the road and sidewalk. Persons 0 and 1 are considered medium risk due to their positions on the road and sidewalk, being very far from the dashcam, and having angles far to the left. Persons 3 and 4 are considered high risk due to their close proximity to the dashcam, being very close to the dashcam, and having undefined and right angles, respectively. Immediate attention and caution are advised to avoid potential collisions.
