### Frame 0001 Analysis

**Summary of Key Frame Information:**
- **Road Position:** The road (road 0) is located in the middle-down region of the frame.
- **Sidewalk Position:** The sidewalk (sidewalk 1) is located in the right-down region of the frame.
- **People Positions and Distances:**
  - **Person 0:** Located at middle-down, very close to the dashcam, with an angle of 89.98 degrees. On road 0, sidewalk 1.
  - **Person 1:** Located at middle-down, very close to the dashcam, with an angle of 89.97 degrees. On road 0, sidewalk 1.
  - **Person 2:** Located at middle-down, very close to the dashcam, with an angle of -89.98 degrees. On road 0, sidewalk 1.
  - **Person 3:** Located at left-down, very close to the dashcam, with an angle of -89.98 degrees. Not on any detected surface.
  - **Person 4:** Located at middle-down, very close to the dashcam, with an angle of -89.98 degrees. Not on any detected surface.
  - **Person 5:** Located at left-down, very close to the dashcam, with an angle of -89.99 degrees. Not on any detected surface.
- **Labels:** Road 0 with confidence 0.79, sidewalk 1 with confidence 0.54.

**Potential Risks:**
- **Persons on Road and Sidewalk:** Persons 0, 1, and 2 are on the road and sidewalk, posing a potential risk of collision.
- **Close Proximity to Dashcam:** All detected persons are very close to the dashcam, increasing the likelihood of a sudden incident.
- **Non-Detected Surfaces:** Persons 3, 4, and 5 are not on any detected surface, which could indicate an unexpected position or movement pattern.

**Risk Evaluation:**
- **Person 0:** High (on road, very close to the dashcam, near 90-degree angle)
- **Person 1:** High (on road, very close to the dashcam, near 90-degree angle)
- **Person 2:** High (on road, very close to the dashcam, near -90-degree angle)
- **Person 3:** Medium (not on any detected surface, very close to the dashcam, negative angle)
- **Person 4:** Medium (not on any detected surface, very close to the dashcam, negative angle)
- **Person 5:** Medium (not on any detected surface, very close to the dashcam, negative angle)

The high-risk evaluation for Persons 0, 1, and 2 is due to their position on the road, very close proximity to the dashcam, and angles near the extremes of the field of view. The medium-risk evaluation for Persons 3, 4, and 5 is attributed to their undetected surface and close proximity to the dashcam. Immediate attention to the road situation is recommended.

- **Person 4:** High (on road and sidewalk, very close to the dashcam, negative angle)
- **Person 5:** High (on road, very close to the dashcam, negative angle)

Frame 0008 exhibits a complex and critical scenario where all detected persons are on the road or sidewalk and in close proximity to the vehicle. The negative and positive angles for the persons indicate that they are positioned almost directly to the left or right of the vehicle. The combination of these factors leads to a high-risk evaluation for all detected persons. Immediate and well-calculated actions are required to ensure safety and mitigate the risk of potential collisions.


### Frame 0009 Analysis

**Summary of Key Frame Information:**
- **Road Position:** The road (road 0) is located in the middle-down region of the frame.
- **Sidewalk Position:** Multiple sidewalks (sidewalk 1, 2, 3) are located in the left-down region.
- **People Positions and Distances:**
  - **Persons 0-2:** Located at left-down or middle-down, close to the dashcam, with angles near -89.99 or 89.91 degrees. On road 0, sidewalk 1, sidewalk 2.
  - **Persons 3-11:** Located at left-down, very close to the dashcam, with angles near -89.99 degrees. On road 0, sidewalk 3, or exclusively on the sidewalk.

**Potential Risks:**
- **Crowded Scene:** A large number of people detected in the frame, some on the road, indicates a complex and potentially hazardous situation.
- **Extreme Angles:** Most detected persons have angles near the extremes of the field of view, indicating proximity to the left side of the vehicle.
- **Proximity to Dashcam:** Persons in close or very close proximity to the dashcam suggest the need for careful navigation.

**Risk Evaluation:**
- **Persons 0-2:** High (on road and sidewalk, close to the dashcam, extreme angles)
- **Persons 3-5, 8-10:** High (on road and sidewalk, very close to the dashcam, negative angles)
- **Persons 6, 7, 11:** Medium (on sidewalk, very close to the dashcam, negative angles)

The situation in Frame 0009 is notably complex due to the large number of detected persons, some of whom are on the road and others on the sidewalks. The high-risk evaluation for Persons 0-10 stems from their locations on the road and/or sidewalks, extreme angles, and proximity to the dashcam. Persons 6, 7, and 11 are evaluated as medium risk since they are only on the sidewalk but still in very close proximity to the vehicle.

This frame necessitates highly attentive monitoring and decision-making to safely navigate the crowded environment and mitigate the risk of collisions or other incidents. Proper consideration of pedestrians' intentions and potential movements is crucial in this scenario.
